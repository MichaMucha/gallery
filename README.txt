Matplotlib gallery
==================

This is a collection of matplotlib samples.

If you want to contribute:

* make sure to put your example in the right directory or create a new one if
  necessary.

* Each example (but the showcases) is supposed to illustrate a concept and the
  source should be small enough such that understanding how things are done is
  easy.

* Try to avoid shortcuts (like 'c' instead of 'color'), this makes things more
  difficult to understand for new comers.

* Try to make your example beautiful, especially for the showcase ones
